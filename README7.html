# About Files
everything is a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file (one that the system reads from only), your monitor is a file (one that the system writes to only) etc. To begin with, this won't affect what we do too much but keep it in mind as it helps with understanding the behavior of Linux as we manage files and directories.

 

## file extension
A file extension is normally a set of characters after a full stop at the end of a file, which denotes what type of file it is. The following are common extensions:

file.exe - an executable file, or program.
file.txt - a plain text file.
file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
In Windows (Operating System) the extension is important and the system uses it to determine what type of file it is.

Under Linux the system actually ignores the extension and looks inside the file to determine what type of file it is. I could rename the file to myself.txt or just myself and Linux would still treat the file as an image file.  Luckily there is a command called file which we can use to find this out.

file [path]

 

## Linux is Case Sensitive
 

Other systems such as Windows are case insensitive when it comes to referring to files.

Linux is not like this. As such it is possible to have two or more files and directories with the same name but letters of different case.

Also be aware of case sensitivity when dealing with command line options. For instance with the command ls there are two options s and S both of which do different things.

Spaces in names
to avoid facing any issues with Spaces in file and directory names there are two approches

1. Quotes
The first approach involves using quotes around the entire item. You may use either single or double quotes (later on we will see that there is a subtle difference between the two but for now that difference is not a problem). Anything inside quotes is considered a single item.

userbash: cd 'Holiday Photos'
userbash: pwd
/home/ryan/Documents/Holiday Photos
2. Escape Characters
Another method is to use what is called an escape character, which is a backslash ( \ ). What the backslash does is escape (or nullify) the special meaning of the next character.

userbash: cd Holiday\ Photos
userbash: pwd
/home/ryan/Documents/Holiday Photos
