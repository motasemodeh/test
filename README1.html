# Mastering Markdown on GitHub


Markdown is a way to style text on the web and control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists.

Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

Gists
Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
Files with the .md or .markdown extension
